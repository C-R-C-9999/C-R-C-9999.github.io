    <h1>About Tyler</h1>

    <p>Tyler is a rising Senior at Tufts University, double majoring in
       Computer Science and English. He uses he/him pronouns. He is 
       originally from Houston, Texas, and he absolutely loves it
       there! One of his favorite things to do is to tell people all about
       his hometown.</p>

    <p>Tyler enjoys reading (currently reading
       <span class="book-title">House of Mirth</span> by Edith Wharton), going
       on walks, drinking coffee, and writing letters to his friends.</p>

    <p>Tyler is currently living in New York City for the summer, which has
       made his walks much more exciting! He are in NYC after having only
       visited twice. He's excited to be in a new place
       and considering moving to New York for work after he finishes undergrad
       next year! If you have any recommendations for fun things to do in New
       York, please let him know!</p>
